One of my classes this semester is based along Flowgorithm. 
About half the kids in my class didn't have Windows PC's, and they were having an awful time trying to access the program.
Ultimately, connecting to our school's Windows 10 Remote Desktop Server was the guided solution.

I hope that other people can benefit from my Mac Version of Flowgorithm!
