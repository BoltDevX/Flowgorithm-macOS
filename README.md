# Flowgorithm For Mac

# Updated and working on Big Sur and Monterey!

#### All Required dependancies are cleanly contained inside this Flowgorithm.app. You do not need to install anything else to run this app on MacOS. 

# Installation

1. Download and extract the most recent ZIP file. 
2. Move the app to /Applications (Optional)
3. Right Click + Open! 
Enjoy!


## If it says "App is Damaged" enter this in terminal:

sudo xattr -rds com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Flowgorithm.app


### Im hoping other people can avoid that by just using this Flowgorithm Mac port!
