# Flowgorithm (MAC OSX)

**WORKING  FOR ME ON HIGH SIERRA. *May also work with*; Mohave 10.14 , Sierra 10.12 and El Capitan 10.11.**


*Flowgorithm is a graphical authoring tool which allows users to write and execute programs using flowcharts. The approach is designed to emphasize the algorithm rather than the syntax of a specific programming language. The flowchart can be converted to several major programming languages.* 

Flowgorithm is a Windows-Only program. I personally need this for school, and there aren't any Mac alternatives that I found comparable. 

I couldn't find much information at all about putting together a Flowgorithm wine container. Furthermore, any info I did come across didn't end up working for me. 

## Installation

1. Download and extract the **Flowgorithm Mac v2.26.2** release ZIP file. 
2. Run Flowgorithm.app.

###### If you run into issues, Right Click the Flowgorithm.App, "View Package Contents" and open the Wineskin.app found inside and debug it using the logs. 

##### (i will update this with more info as needed)
