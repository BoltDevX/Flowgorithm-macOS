# Flowgorithm For Mac

**WORKING ON Catalina 10.15, Mohave 10.14, Sierra 10.12, and El Capitan 10.11.**


*Flowgorithm is a graphical authoring tool which allows users to write and execute programs using flowcharts. 
The approach is designed to emphasize the algorithm rather than the syntax of a specific programming language. 
The flowchart can be converted to several major programming languages.* 

Flowgorithm is a Windows-Only program. I personally need this for school, and there aren't any Mac alternatives that I found comparable. 

I couldn't find much information at all about putting together a Flowgorithm wine container. 
Furthermore, any info I did come across didn't end up working for me. 
After many attempts I finally got a working app. ENJOY!

## Installation

1. Download and extract most recent ZIP file. 
2. Run Flowgorithm.app from Applications folder.
